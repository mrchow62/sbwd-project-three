          <figcaption>
            I bought these shoes almost a year ago, and they are still going strong. I have had countless discussions with my friends about whether these shoes are orange or red; I think they are orange. What do you think?

              <figcaption>
                I bought these shoes I wanted to have a semi-formal shoe. The break in period for these shoes was about 3 days of wearing, after which they feel very comfortable.
