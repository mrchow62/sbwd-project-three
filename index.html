        This website is about my shoes. In this section, I will write about how I started gaining interest in shoes, and how I got this very expensive hobby. I will write about why I think I love shoes so much, and stuff like that.

            I bought these shoes almost a year ago, and they are still going strong. I have had countless discussions with my friends about whether these shoes are orange or red; I think they are orange. What do you think?

                I bought these shoes I wanted to have a semi-formal shoe. The break in period for these shoes was about 3 days of wearing, after which they feel very comfortable.

      <h2> Where I buy from </h2>
      <p>
        I try to always try on before buying. My favorite stores are DSW, Nike Store, Adidas Store, Payless Shoes, to name a few. I bought the Adidas NMD_C2s from the official Adidas website, the Nike Flyknit Roshe Twos from www.finishline.com, and the Cole Haan Original Grand Oxfords from DSW in Chicago downtown.

      <h2> How I take care of my shoes </h2>
      <article>
      <p>
        I make sure to clean my shoes using the sppropriate tools every weekend. For the Adidas NMD_C2 shoes, special care needs to be taken as they are made from a suede material. I use a suede brush and eraser regualrly to keep them clean. For the other shoes, I use Kiwi Sneaker cleaner to clean them thoroughly.
